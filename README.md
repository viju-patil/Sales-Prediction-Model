# Sales-Prediction-Model
## Description

The Sales Prediction Model project aims to develop an effective regression model to predict future sales based on historical sales data. This model is particularly useful for businesses in the real estate sector, helping them make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and budget planning.

### Objectives:
- **Forecasting**: Utilize historical data to accurately forecast future sales trends.
- **Resource Allocation**: Enable better planning and allocation of resources by providing insights into expected sales.
- **Decision-Making**: Support stakeholders in making data-driven decisions based on predicted sales figures.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes steps to handle missing values and encode categorical variables, ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Various regression algorithms (such as Linear Regression and Random Forest) are employed to train the model on the prepared dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The model's effectiveness is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score, providing insights into its predictive accuracy.
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Users can input new property features and receive sales predictions, facilitating better business decisions.

Overall, this project serves as a practical implementation of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential of data-driven solutions in the real estate industry.
